# Problem & Related Work
There’s an existing divide between local charities and community members. Many locals may be interested in becoming involved in donation and volunteer work but may not recognize charities in their local areas. Donors tend to unknowingly over donate specific items while a charity may need other items instead. Local charities thus struggle from not having enough volunteers or a balanced quantity of their supplies. Our team aims to help resolve this struggle by creating a better communication platform between individuals and their nearby charities. By resolving this issue, people in need will have a greater chance of receiving the items and services they need from these nonprofits. Community building can also grow from having locals become more involved with nearby nonprofits.
Similar but limited solutions have been accomplished by Feeding America and MealConnect, which connect donors with surplus food to their local Feeding America food bank partners. There is also MEANS which serves as a communication platform dedicated to emergency food providers and donors. But, these organizations are solely dedicated to food demand. There still needs to be a means of filling nonprofits’ need for obtaining other items such as hygiene products, winter clothes, and books. These platforms also don’t resolve a charity’s need for volunteers or workers or bring any community involvement either. Therefore, we developed a platform to help these unanswered issues.

# User Research
By conducting user interviews, we learned more about how individuals get in touch with a charity, and their methods to get news on them. It appeared that knowledge about local charities wasn’t commonplace. Individuals obtain information through insider groups like schools, scout organizations, and counselors. All our interviewees first heard about their charity through friends, family, or school. Most interviewees didn’t know much about the charities until after they became more involved, either. One interviewer was quite passionate about trying to find new ways for other people to learn about the charity they were involved in. They felt that the organization is overlooked in the community. We also found that the target audience we interviewed (teenagers and young adults) are quite busy. This led to some of them easily ignoring email updates from charities they have become less involved with.
These interviews led us to better envision the sort of users that would use our app. This includes busy students, volunteers eager to share information about their charities, and charities seeking new, effective ways of finding local support. A busy target audience like ours implies that the design should be focused on making the user quickly navigate to the exact thing they need. This suggests a simple design with common visual indications of a search function and where specific organizations’ information can be kept for the user’s use. We found a quick search function with the ability to filter charities by distance and focus to be the best-suited option. The charity profiles should have highly visible contact information and postings of what items and volunteering positions that charities need. These elements would assist users with limited time in finding charities based on their unique needs, interests, and skillsets. We also wanted to make the profile making process and posting to be intuitive for charities. By doing this, the app would be accessible to charity workers with any level of technical knowledge. Our goals were the words: simple, intuitive and fast.

# Paper Prototyping




Screenshots of Paper Prototype
Our concept received a relatively positive reception. Our UI appears intuitive in terms of making a new account and searching for charities. We still needed to make improvements on visibility, though. The charity cards needed clear indicators for clickability. One user took a while to realize that the card needed to be pressed to find out more information on the charity page. The cards’ general focus tags also need more visible. Users should discover what the charity is involved in and use this to decide which best interests them. This is important as we saw only one user take into account the charity's focus when clicking on a page. We also needed to find a way to draw more emphasis on the specific volunteer opportunities and donation items that the charity needs. We found that the paper prototype was a good start but there were small design changes that needed to be taken.
	Based on the testers' reactions, we found that the design we had picked out was a solid start. The main alterations were creating more visibility of what is more clickable with shadowing and hovering indicators. We also decided on making the tags larger and creating filters under the search bar to let users know that sorting by interest was also an option alongside distance sorting. Otherwise, we decided to utilize the paper prototype’s design.

# High-Fidelity Prototyping
There were three components we chose to implement: data filtering, user forms, and user profiles.
### Data Filter

The data filtering component was achieved by introducing a search bar and buttons that can further filter out the search result based on category. The buttons can be found under the search bar. By adding this component, we were able to introduce a search function that takes into account a user’s ideals or interests. Since the user can filter out nearby charities by general focus, they can choose a charity based on both location and general fit. This component, in general, helps support the task of searching for charities and selecting those that stick out the most for users.
### User Forms

We also added user forms as a way for charities to create a new account. Unlike a general user, a charity needs to provide additional information to make its account. The user forms are accessible when one signs up as a charity. The component resembles the most typical forms to be simple and intuitive. The form also includes indicators of when the user hasn’t filled out necessary information or has provided invalid inputs. Through this component, we were able to introduce a charity-focus task of making a new account as a charity.
### User Profiles

Lastly, we added user profiles to the website. This was achieved by introducing a sign-up/login method for general users, and having distinct profiles for charities and users. Unlike charities, the users can sign up by simply providing an email, name, and password. While the charity pages consist of general descriptions, contact information, and postings, a user profile functions more like a dashboard that a user can keep track of recent posts made by their favorite charities and can receive suggestions of what charities to look into. Thus, this final component allows the task of creating a new account as a user and look at what is currently on their dashboard.

# Reflection
We were able to develop a prototype demonstrating the most basic features we wanted out of the website. This includes a search bar on the home page and filtering based on a charity’s specific goal/interest. Clicking a charity card on the results page greets the user with a charity profile to explore. This profile contains the charity’s basic description and contact information at the top. The page also features the charity’s most needed positions, donation items, and posts. The site also has the capability of creating your charity or user page. Charities can create an account through a form while users fill out the basic sign up information. The user's profile works as a dashboard containing the recent postings of the user’s preferred charities as a way of keeping updated. Each post features buttons to unfavorite a charity or saves a post for later. At the bottom, the user can find suggested charities based on their recent activities. Overall, we managed to design the site’s basic search features to find a new charity to volunteer and donate at and profiles to provide users a quick way of keeping updated on the charities they are interested in.
	Given the opportunity, we would have liked to have extended the prototype to feature how the charity would be able to edit their profile, add new posts, and indicate which out of the positions and items they need the most urgently. We could have also added how users could have been able to see their saved posts and keep track of their favorite charities. This would have needed charity cards and profiles to include buttons to add them to the user’s favorites as well as new pages for the user to look at saved posts and the list of favorite charities. We could have also featured user posts discussing their experience with a charity. Another great addition would have been making our app more accessible on devices other than computers. We also seem to have made the most changes based on users struggling with the visibility of certain features. So we could have further explored ways to make the site easier to utilize. While our site features the most basic elements of what we hoped out of the app, there still some features that we would have liked to implement further.
