Any copy or portion of the Documentation will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The OneLogin Services will be provided to Subscriber and its designated users that are paid for by Subscriber, which may include its employees, contractors, dealers/distributors and other third parties working for Subscriber.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      1.6 California Consumer Privacy Act.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      1.6.1 Definitions.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “Business” has the meaning given that term under the CCPA.
      “CCPA” means the California Consumer Privacy Act, as may be amended from time to time, and any rules or regulations implementing the foregoing.
      “Personal Information” means any information Subscriber provides to OneLogin that relates to or could be associated with an individual or household.
      “Service Provider” means an entity that receives Personal Information and is prohibited from retaining, using, selling, or disclosing such information (a) for any purpose other than the specific purpose of performing OneLogin Services for Subscriber, including to improve its own services or to develop new services, or (b) outside of the Service Provider’s direct relationship with the Business.
      1.6.2 The parties agree that, for purposes of the CCPA, Subscriber is a Business and OneLogin is a Service Provider. Subscriber represents and warrants that it will only provide or make Personal Information available to OneLogin in compliance with the CCPA.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      1.6.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, OneLogin shall not (1) retain or use Personal Information other than as needed to perform OneLogin Services or (2) Sell or otherwise disclose such Personal Information except to Service Providers needed to render OneLogin Services.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      1.6.4 Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Subscriber agrees that OneLogin, its affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns will not be liable under the Agreement for any claim arising from any action or omission by OneLogin that resulted from the Subscriber’s instructions or from Subscriber’s failure to comply with its obligations under the CCPA.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      1.7 Protection against Unauthorized Use. Safeguarding the security of Subscriber Data (as defined in Section 2.1 below) that resides within the OneLogin Services is a shared responsibility between OneLogin (the “Data Processor”) and the Subscriber (the “Data Controller”) and, consequently: (a) OneLogin is responsible for any unauthorized access to, alteration of, or the deletion, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store and/or process any Subscriber Data that can be traced back to OneLogin’s personnel or OneLogin’s security control failure, and (b) Subscriber is responsible for any unauthorized access to, alteration of, or the deletion, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store and/or process any Subscriber Data that can be traced back to Subscriber’s personnel or Subscriber’s security control failure. Furthermore, OneLogin is responsible for properly configuring and administering the OneLogin Services and taking appropriate measures to maintain the security, protection and backup of Subscriber Data, including using encryption technology to protect Subscriber Data, and to routinely archive Subscriber Data. Subscriber shall be responsible for Subscriber Data that is added, modified, and removed from its OneLogin Services account and for maintaining the security of its systems that interface with the OneLogin Services and any account access passwords relevant to the OneLogin Services, and will use reasonable efforts to prevent any unauthorized use of the OneLogin Services and Documentation and immediately notify OneLogin in writing of any unauthorized use that comes to Subscriber’s attention. If there is unauthorized use by anyone who obtained access to the OneLogin Services directly or indirectly through Subscriber, Subscriber will take all steps reasonably necessary to terminate the unauthorized use. Subscriber will cooperate and assist with any actions taken by OneLogin to prevent or terminate unauthorized use of the OneLogin Services or Documentation.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      1.8 Incident Management. In the event that OneLogin or Subscriber becomes aware that the security of the OneLogin Services is adversely impacted, and this event subsequently leads to Subscriber Data in OneLogin’s control being subject to use or disclosure not authorized by this Agreement (a “Security Incident”), the knowledgeable party will promptly (but in any case not later than seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of such Security Incident): (a) assess the nature and scope of the Security Incident; (b) identify the Subscriber Data involved, if any; (c) take appropriate steps to contain, control and stop the Security Incident; and (d) collaborate with the other party in providing relevant information that can be used to address and mitigate the impact of the Security Incident, subject to any request by law enforcement or other government agency to withhold such notice pending the completion of an investigation.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      1.9 Reservation of Rights. OneLogin reserves to itself all rights in and to the OneLogin Services and Documentation not expressly granted to Subscriber under this Agreement.
